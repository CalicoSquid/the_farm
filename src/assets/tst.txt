For as long as I can remember, I’ve dreamed of carving out a simple life in nature, of building 
something with my own hands and living life on my own terms. Finding a place where nobady 
can tell me what to do... That dream has finally taken its first real step toward becoming reality. 
A few weeks ago, I made an agreement to purchase a 5,500-square-meter plot (about 1 1/2 acres) of 
land in the village of Rijeka Crnojevića, here in Montenegro. It’s been untouched for the past 20 years, completely overgrown, full of rocks and thorny pomegranate trees. But beneath it all lies so much potential—the ruins of an ancient monastery, the remnants of a long-forgotten orchard, and enough fertile land to sustain me for many years to come. If everything goes to plan, (fingers crossed), this place, long forgotten and slowly being reclaimed by nature, will one day become my home. This won’t be a quick or easy project. The land needs to be cleared, the ruins carefully restored, and a livable space built from the ground up. But honestly that’s the best part. It will take years, but step by step, I want to eventually turn this land into my own little escape fom the world. I don’t have a rigid plan yet. I’ll figure things out as I go, tackling one challenge at a time. The goal is simple: to create a home, a place where I can live surrounded by beautiful nature and ancient history, as far from society as i dare! I’ve created this website to document the process, not just for myself but for anyone who wants to follow along. Whether you’re a friend, family, or just someone who’s curious about what it takes to reclaim an old ruin and turn it into a home, I hope you’ll enjoy seeing how this journey unfolds and will be posting here once things get underway. ❤️❤️
