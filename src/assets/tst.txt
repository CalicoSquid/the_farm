# My Journey to Building a Life in Nature

For as long as I can remember, I’ve dreamed of carving out a life in nature, of building something with my own hands and living on my own terms. That dream has finally taken its first real step toward becoming reality.

A few weeks ago, I made an agreement to purchase a 5,500-square-meter plot of land in the village of **Rijeka Crnojevića**, Montenegro. It’s been untouched for the past 20 years, completely overgrown, but at its heart lies something truly special—a ruin, the remains of an ancient monastery. This place, long forgotten and slowly being reclaimed by nature, will one day become my home.

This won’t be a quick or easy project. The land needs to be cleared, the ruins carefully restored, and a livable space built from the ground up. But that’s exactly what excites me. Every stone I lift, every wall I rebuild, every part of this place that I bring back to life will be done with my own two hands. It will take years, but that’s part of the adventure—step by step, I’ll make this place my own.

##The Plan

I don’t have a rigid plan. I’ll figure things out as I go, tackling one challenge at a time. The goal is simple: to create a home for myself and my cats, a place where I can live surrounded by the beauty of this land and the weight of its history.

##Documenting the Journey

I’ve created this website to document the process, not just for myself but for anyone who wants to follow along. Whether you’re a friend, family member, or just someone who’s curious about what it takes to reclaim an old ruin and turn it into a home, I hope you’ll enjoy seeing how this journey unfolds.

## Conclusion

This is my side of the mountain now, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.
